# Jukebox

Welcome! This website is a simple music player with preloaded tracks. There are five songs in total. You can play/pause them, skip to the next song or go back to the last one. You can also choose one from the list.

The music player created through javascript and has object-oriented programming elements. Using CSS I attempted to give the website a clean and simple look. With Transparent icons, feel free to use the source code to create your own music players!

#### Enjoy it!
